## Protect your organization against ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that, when it infects computers, restricts user access to files, and often threatens the permanent deletion of data, unless a crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin) ransom is paid. The threat of ransomware is expected to increase with the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has seen a large increase in malware:

> ### over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by year's end.
-- <cite>IC3, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center</cite>  

### Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific

Organizations need to define how they detect, protect and respond to ransomware attacks. As is the case with other types of malicious attacks, [multiple layers of security]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _services/protect-assets-service.md %}) is a recommended approach to protect an organization from a wide variety of risks:

* **Identify risk —** Carry out a risk assessment
* **Define security and privacy policies —** Reflect the objectives set by management
* **Customize education, training and awareness programs —** Identify and adapt training for all user profiles
* **Keep information systems current and up to date —** Audit information systems and define update procedures
* **Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans —** Backups, incident management, contingency planning
* **Install preventive controls —** Firewalls, endpoint security
* **Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails —** Implement a security log management infrastructure
* **Evaluate cyber liability insurance —** Protection against major losses

Ransomware attacks should be reported to the proper authorities. In most cases, authorities will strongly suggest not paying a ransom in response to an attack. There is, after all, no guarantee that paying a ransom will result in the recovery of the data in question. It goes without saying, preventing a malware attack will always be preferable to the alternative of having to deal with the consequences of having your data held hostage by cybercriminals.
